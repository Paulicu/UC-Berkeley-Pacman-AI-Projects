# UC Berkeley Pacman Projects

### Overview
This repository contains my implementations of various algorithms for the Pac-Man Projects, developed by UC Berkeley as part of the [CS188 Intro to AI](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) course. These projects were created as assignments for my Artificial Intelligence course taken in my third year of university. The projects cover a wide range of artificial intelligence concepts and techniques applied to Pac-Man, including pathfinding, adversarial search, reinforcement learning, and more.


## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Pathfinding Algorithms:**
   - [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
   - [Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
   - [Uniform Cost Search](http://math.wikia.com/wiki/Uniform_cost_search)
   - [A-Star Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

2. **Adversarial Search Algorithms:**
   - [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
   - [Alpha-Beta Pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
   - [Expectiminimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectiminimax_tree)

3. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:**
   - [Value Iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Value_iteration)
   - [Q-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)
   - [Epsilon Greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit#Semi-uniform_strategies)
   - [Approximate Q-Learning](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/cs63/s16/slides/3-25_approximate_Q-learning.pdf)

4. **Additional Concepts:**
   - [Heuristic Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science))

## Project Details
- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code

## Project Structure
Each project is implemented within its designated folder. Detailed explanations, code, and any specific project-related information are available in their respective directories.

## Instructions
